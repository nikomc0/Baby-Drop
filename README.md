# BabyDrop

A web app that seeks to eliminate even one more child left in a hot car event.

As a family you can schedule the days your child will be dropped off at daycare.
As well as who is responsible for dropping off and picking up the child. As the
time approaches the drop off parent will receive an SMS message alerting that its
time for drop off, and will require a confirmation from that parent in order to
turn of the notification.
